  Round 2 Questions
  1. Remove duplicates from a sorted Array (such that each integer should only
  be repeated at the max twice)
  Eg-1:
  Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
  Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
  
  Eg-2:
  Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,2,-1,2,3,3]
  Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,,]
  
  2 . There is a classroom with a bunch of students in it. There is an entrance
  exam to be part of this classroom.
  
  A bunch of students have already given this exam.
  The ranking of the students is based on the marks they receive.
  
  For the class:
  Marks = {39, 38, 38, 36, 34, 31, 28}
  Ranking would be:
  39 = 1
  38 = 2
  38 = 2
  36 = 3
  A new student wants to join the class. That student gives the entrance test,
  the marks are x.
  Write a program that will print the rank of this new student in the gi…


  Questions asked in 2nd round
  Add new node to sorted linked list
  Add one to last element of array and if there is carry in that element add it
  to previous element

 2 coding questions: 
 1st non repeating char from string, 
 print rank of new student based on the marks, given marks of all the class, 
Projects I have done, which all technologies I have used, why I used them, explain project working,etc
Some hr questions, like timmings, location, etc


Total rounds = 3
The first round was easy , they asked me 2 easy questions and 1 easy-medium level question
There were no theory questions.
Second round:-
Again 3 questions were asked, 1 was easy rest were medium level, but the interviewer tries to trick you asking various twist.

Third round:-
4 questions were asked to me, the guy who took my interview was tough, he asked me test cases where my logic was failing in a certain question rather than the solution and after that he talked about my projects asked some tough practical questions.


INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE OF A RECENTLY PLACED STUDENT
 Find sorted subsequence of size 3
Input:
A[] = [9, 2, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4]       
Output: True
Explanation: A subsequence [2,3,4] exists

A[] = [1, 1, 3]
Output: False

 Reverse the string, keeping spaces intact at their original position as per input string.
Input: Raja software lab
Output: bale rawtfosa jaR


 Take an array and k as inputs. Multiply k with last digit from array and insert Unit digit of the multiplication on last digit and multiply carry (which is at 10th place) with previous number. And do similar till array ends.
Input: [1, 7, 9]
k = 4
Output: [2, 1, 6]

Input: [7, 7, 9]
k = 4
Output: [1, 4 , 1, 6]

 Given an array of coins and you a value v, return the minimum number of coins whose sum equal to value and print the
 coin also
Coins ={25,10,5} , v = 30
Output:-

2 coins  
25,5
 Given two array  arr={2,4,7,9,1} and index = {4,1,0,2,3}, update the arr according to the value given in index 
Output:- {7,4,9,1,2}

Round 2 Questions 
1.  Remove duplicates from a sorted Array (such that each integer should only be repeated at the max twice)
Eg-1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]

Eg-2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,2,-1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,,]

2 . There is a classroom with a bunch of students in it. There is an entrance exam to be part of this classroom.

A bunch of students have already given this exam.
The ranking of the students is based on the marks they receive.

For the class:
Marks = {39, 38, 38, 36, 34, 31, 28}
Ranking would be:
39 = 1
38 = 2
38 = 2
36 = 3
A new student wants to join the class. That student gives the entrance test, the marks are x.
Write a program that will print the rank of this new student in the gi…
 given class.
void printRank {ArrayList<Integer> currentMarksOfClass, int newCandidateMark) {}
For the class:
Marks = {39, 38, 38, 36, 34, 31, 28}
Ranking would be:
39 = 1
38 = 2
38 = 2
36 = 3
.
.
So if the parameters are:  
{39, 38, 38, 36, 34, 31, 28}, 38: It should return 2
{39, 38, 38, 36, 34, 31, 28}, 37: It should return 3

Both the Problem should be done in TC : O(N) and SC : O(1)

To ME
//You hv 2 and 5 coins and you hv to make a given rs(sum) using 2 and 5 coins reuturn the no of 2 and 5 coins we can make the sum=target
//target 13  used 4*2+1*5=13 4 2 coins and 1 5 coins 

// Java program to convert 12 hour 
Time Conversion
Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note
12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

//given a Tic Toe  Game (Two Players X and Y)  matrix both players hv played their turn  now X will play 
its last turn find X will win or Not
